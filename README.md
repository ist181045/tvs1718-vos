### Problem Description

The development of large information systems is a complex process and demands several layers of
abstraction. One first step is the specification of the problem in a rigorous way. After a rigorous
specification of the problem, one may perform formal analysis and prove correctness of the
implementation. If the implementation is not correct, one may discover flaws that would not be easy
to detect in any other way. Complementarily, and in particular when a solution has already been
implemented, the quality of the solution may be assessed by running tests in order to detect
existing flaws.

The project of this course consists in the design of a set of test suites given a specification.
This specification models an application that manages the data of a provider of mobile telephony
called *Vos*. The main goal of this project is for the students to learn the concepts related to
software testing and acquire some experience in designing test cases.
